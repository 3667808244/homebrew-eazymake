# EazyMake Homebrew formula
#
# Installs the prebuilt binary for the current platform from the EazyMake
# GitHub Release. Each tarball (ezmk-<os>-<arch>.tar.gz) contains `ezmk`
# (the binary) and `_ezmk` (zsh completion).
#
#   brew tap 3667808244/eazymake
#   brew install ezmk
#
# Repo: https://github.com/3667808244/EazyMake
# Release assets: https://github.com/3667808244/EazyMake/releases
#
# Note: macOS Intel (x64) has no prebuilt asset yet — the `macos-13` runner is
# not allocated on GitHub's free tier, so the x64 job stalls and the release
# never carries `ezmk-macos-x64.tar.gz`. Intel Macs get a clean "unsupported
# on this architecture" error from brew until a binary is published.
